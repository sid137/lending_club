          <h2>Interest</h2>

          <p>
              The fundamental idea behind interest, is that the borrower of a
              loan is obligated to repay more than they initially borrowed.

              We can think of this intrinsically as due to several reasons:
              <ul>
                <li>
                The lender should be compensated for making an unnecessary use
                of their money and taking a risk on the borrower
                </li>
                <li>
                The lender could have profited better by putting their money to
                use in other ways than lending it to the borrower
                </li>
              </ul>
              As a result, the interest is the <em>compensation</em> that the
              lender is given for having catered to the borrower
          </p>

          <p>The goal of extending a loan with interst is to have a high amount
          of money at the end of the loan period.  We essentially want to have
          our initial amount, plus sum yet to be determined sum
          </p>

            \begin{equation}
              Total = Principal + Interest
            \end{equation}

          <h3>Simple Interest</h3>
          The simplest way to derive an interest payment is to consider it as a
          repayment of a fraction \(f\) of the initial amount \(P_0\) that was borrowed.

          <div class="well">
            \begin{equation}
              Interest = fP_o < P_0
            \end{equation}
          </div>

          When we continually add on interest amounts of this form, we can
          visualize this as a fixed amount of the initial capital, working to
          earn money.  Because the income earning portion never changes or
          grows, the total growth of capital remains linear.  We can represent
          this mathematically as an Arithmetic Series, where each payment
          amount is a term an the sequence. 

          <div class="well">
            \begin{equation}
            S_n = P_0 + \sum_{k=1}^N a_k  \\ 
            \end{equation}
            \begin{equation}
            S_n = P_0 + Na =  P_0 + NfP_0 \\
            \end{equation}
            \begin{equation}
            S_n = P_0(1 + Nf)
            \end{equation}
          </div>

          Because each interest payment is a fixed amount \(a = fP_0\), the \(a_k\) terms
          are all constant, and we thus have a linear growth of capital until
          the \(N^{th}\) payment.

          Step 1

          Determine Loan AMount
          Determine Nominal Intrest
          Determine Periodic Interest
          Calculate Payment Amount using Annuity Formula
          Calculate New balace:
               Apply interest to previous balance
               subtract payment
               Attribute portions = 
                  Interest Portion =
